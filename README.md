elite-dangerous-tools
=====================

Simple script for finding rare goods routes in Elite: Dangerous.

Scrapes data from Cmdr Dragonic's excellent Google Sheet, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Zv55yEjVdHrNzkH7BPnTCtXRs8GDHqchYjo9Svkyh4/pubhtml

Originally, I wrote this with a cluster finder in PHP; then changed it to Javascript; but I never got the cluster/path finding working well in Javascript, so I gave up and just made this an easier to filter and sort version of the spreadsheet.  It'll do for now.
